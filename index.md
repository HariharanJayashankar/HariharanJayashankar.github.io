# Education

- **M.Sc in Economics - London School of Economics \hfill Period: 2016-2017**

    - Grade: Merit
    - Relevant Coursework: *Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Econometrics, Development Economics*
    - Thesis: **"Effects of ASEAN Free Trade Agreement on Tariff Evasion Levels"**
        - With a large amount of trade data of different countries from the ASEAN countries, this paper finds that the AFTA had no significant impact in reducing tariff evasion. This is in strong contrast to other papers studying other free trade agreements like NAFTA where tariff evasion levels reduce or change forms after a country is signed into the agreement. The paper also presents evidence that this may be because tariff evasion in this region mostly took place via quantity underreporting as opposed to the usual price underreporting found in other countries.
