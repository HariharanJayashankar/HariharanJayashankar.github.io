# Education

- **M.Sc in Economics - London School of Economics (Period: 2016-2017)**

    - Grade: Merit
    - Relevant Coursework: *Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, Econometrics, Development Economics*
    - Thesis: **Effects of Tariff Rates on Tariff Evasion**
        - Apart from the usual benefits of free trade, tariff rate reduction can also be expected to bring with it a reduction in tariff evasion rates. This paper provides a basic theoretical framework for thinking through the structure of tariff evasion. We construct a general equilibrium model for a small open economy and show through numerical methods that tariff rates and tariff evasion rates move together. We then show preliminary empirical evidence of the relationship between tariff evasion and tariff levels in the data in the context of the ASEAN Free Trade Area.
