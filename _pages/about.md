Hello! Welcome to my personal website.

I am currently an Pre-Doctoral Fellow at NBER working on Economics and Genetics under [Daniel J Benjamin](https://www.danieljbenjamin.com/), [David Cesarini](https://as.nyu.edu/content/nyu-as/as/faculty/david-cesarini.html), [Patrick Turley](https://www.paturley.com/) and [Alexander Young](https://geneticvariance.wordpress.com/).

I hope to pursue a PhD in Economics soon. My wider interests are inequality, financial inclusion, and monetary policy.
